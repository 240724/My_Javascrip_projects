A function that collects 2 string numbers sent as parameters inside the function and returns the result as a string. 
However, in javascript, a maximum of 16 digits can be displayed as Number. So the function should find the result without 
reducing the digits of the number. In other words, if it has 40 digits in total, it should be able to show all 40 digits.
